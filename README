Nginx Upstream Fair Proxy Load Balancer
--

Description:
--

The Nginx fair proxy balancer enhances the standard round-robin load balancer provided
with Nginx so that it will track busy back end servers (e.g. Thin, Ebb, Mongrel)
and balance the load to non-busy server processes.

Further information can be found on http://nginx.localdomain.pl/

Ezra Zygmuntowicz has a good writeup of the fair proxy load balancer and how to use it here:

Installation:
--

You'll need to re-compile Nginx from source to include this module.
Modify your compile of Nginx by adding the following directive
(modified to suit your path of course):

./configure --with-http_ssl_module --add-module=/absolute/path/to/nginx-upstream-fair
make
make install


Usage:
--

Change your Nginx config file's upstream block to include the 'fair' directive:

upstream mongrel {
    fair;
    server 127.0.0.1:5000;
    server 127.0.0.1:5001;
    server 127.0.0.1:5002;
  }
